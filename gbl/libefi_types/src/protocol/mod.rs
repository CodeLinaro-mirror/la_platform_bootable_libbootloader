//! Rust UEFI protocols.
//!
//! This module provides Rust traits for protocols used by GBL. The protocol
//! APIs are designed to mirror the underlying UEFI protocol definitions, but
//! modified to be more idiomatic Rust, for example:
//!
//! * buffers are slices rather than (pointer, length) pairs
//! * output params are converted to return values instead when feasible
//! * return values are `Result`s rather than raw status enum
//!
//! These protocol traits are usable both on the client side (UEFI application)
//! and the provider side (UEFI firmware). GBL will use the client-side APIs,
//! but devices are not required to use the provider-side APIs, they are just
//! offered as an option to make it easier to build GBL-compatible UEFI firmware
//! in Rust.
//!

//!                                           Rust provider implementation
//! ```
//!
//! This library does not provide a full UEFI firmware implementation, it only
//! aims to wrap protocol pointers. How those pointers get into and out of the
//! UEFI stack is up to the particular implementation.
//!
//! # Client usage
//!
//! Protocol clients such as GBL will get the protocol C pointer from UEFI,
//! then wrap them in a [Client] object, which exposes protocol functionality
//! via safe Rust APIs.
//!
//! # Provider usage
//!
//! Protocol providers such as the UEFI firmware or a driver will implement
//! the protocol Rust backend, then pass it into a [Provider], which exposes
//! a raw C pointer to register with the UEFI stack. Calls on this C pointer
//! will route back into the Rust backend implementation.
//!
//! Additionally there is a [BridgeToRust] trait that [Provider] requires, which
//! properly initializes the C struct to pass calls back into the Rust backend.
//! This will be provided for protocols supported by this library, but can also
//! be implemented manually for new protocols or if users want to define a
//! different Rust API to wrap an existing protocol.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! In UEFI, protocols can be opened by multiple clients. For Rust, this means
//! that we must use non-mutable references to avoid violating single-owner
//! mutability requirements. If a protocol backend needs to modify state, it
//! must use interior mutability to safely do so.
//!
//! For [Client]s, this means that the protocol methods all take a const
//! `&self`, but may still change internal state. For example, Block I/O
//! Protocol calls to read/write may end up modifying the associated `Media`
//! state. Ensuring safe shared access is normally the responsibility of the
//! protocol backend, whether implemented in Rust or C, though there are a
//! few exceptions. See [Client] docs for details.
//!
//! For this library's [Provider] backend, the [Provider] documentation has
//! details on how to safely meet these requirements.

/// This wraps the protocol C struct and exposes the Rust API, so that the

///
/// # Ownership and concurrency
///
/// In most cases it's the protocol implementation's responsibility to ensure
/// proper ownership and concurrency protection to protect against data races,
/// but when a protocol struct has a raw pointer to mutable data, the backend
/// can't know when this data is being accessed.
///
/// In these cases, to ensure safe usage the client must protect against data
/// races itself. These functions will be marked `unsafe` with guidance on how
/// to properly access the data; in UEFI environments this generally means
/// raising the TPL to the protocol's maximum supported level according to the
/// [spec](https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/07_Services_Boot_Services.html#tpl-restrictions)
/// which ensures no other client can concurrently modify the data.

/// Higher priority levels will interrupt lower levels, which leads to a few
/// complications:
///
/// * There is no priority inversion support, which means something like a
///   standard mutex will not work here; if lower-priority code holds a mutex
///   when higher-priority code tries to grab it, the system will deadlock
///
/// * Rust `Cell`-type classes are not thread-safe, so could cause data races
///   and undefined behavior if used directly from multiple TPLs
///
/// Each protocol has unique requirements, but a general approach might look

///         //    Depending on the firmware implementation, you may also need
