## GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL

### Summary

This protocol provides a mechanism for the EFI firmware to build and update OS
configuration data:

- device tree (select components with which to build the final one)
- bootconfig (append fixups)
- FIT configuration (select the configuration corresponding to the platform)

GBL will load and verify the data provided by boot partitions, and then call
these protocol functions to give the firmware a chance to construct and adjust
the data as needed for the particular device. Device tree fixups (including
kernel command line) are handled by the `EFI_DT_FIXUP` protocol.

If no runtime modifications are necessary, this protocol may be left
unimplemented, in which case GBL autoselection logic will be used. Refer to
[`SelectDeviceTrees()`][select_device_trees] description for more details.

#### FixupBootConfig

Applies bootconfig fixups. See [`FixupBootConfig()`][fixup_bootconfig] for more
information.

#### SelectDeviceTrees

Selects components such as base device tree and overlays to build the final
device tree. See [`SelectDeviceTrees()`][select_device_trees] for more
information.

#### SelectFitConfiguration

Selects the FIT configuration corresponding to the platform. See
[`SelectFitConfiguration()`][select_fit_configuration] for more information.

#### FixupZbi

Applies ZBI fixups (Fuchsia kernels only). See [`FixupZbi()`][fixup_zbi] for
more information.

## GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL.FixupBootConfig()

### Summary

Provides runtime fixups to the bootconfig.

### Prototype

```c
typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI *GBL_EFI_FIXUP_BOOTCONFIG)(
  IN GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL *Self,
  IN UINTN                             BootConfigSize,
  IN CONST CHAR8                       *BootConfig,
  IN OUT UINTN                         *FixupBufferSize,
  OUT CHAR8                            *Fixup
  );
```

### Parameters

Ownership of all the parameters is loaned only for the duration of the function
call, and must not be retained by the protocol after returning.

#### Self

A pointer to the `GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL` instance.

#### BootConfigSize

Size of the bootconfig built by GBL.

#### BootConfig

Pointer to the bootconfig built by GBL. Trailing data isn't provided.

#### FixupBufferSize

On function call, this points to the fixup buffer size provided by `Fixup`. The
implementation is free to provide fixup data up to this size.

If the buffer is not large enough to fit the fixup, implementation must update
`FixupBufferSize` with the required size and return `EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL`; GBL
will then allocate a larger buffer, discard all modifications and repeat the
`FixupBootConfig` call.

`FixupBufferSize` must be updated on success to let GBL determine the provided
bootconfig fixup size.

#### Fixup

Pointer to a pre-allocated buffer to store the generated bootconfig fixup. GBL
verifies and appends provided data into the final bootconfig. FW may either
return `EFI_UNSUPPORTED`, or leave the buffer unchanged and set
`FixupBufferSize` to `0` to indicate that no fixup is required.

The FW implementation can generate a fixup with the following restrictions:

- on return, the data must be valid bootconfig (trailer is optional)
- provided data must never exceed the provided `FixupBufferSize`
- no libavb arguments may be provided (see Security below)

### Description

[Bootconfig][bootconfig] as a format is similar to the kernel command line, but
intended for user space consumption rather than kernel.

Implementation should only append the bootconfig parameters, GBL will
automatically update the bootconfig trailer metadata afterwards. Override
bootconfig operator `:=` may be used to re-define some of the values provided by
GBL.

### Security

To ensure the integrity of verified boot data, this protocol will not be allowed
to append any bootconfig provided by [libavb][libavb]. If any of these
parameters are provided, GBL will treat this as a failed boot attempt:

- `androidboot.veritymode*`
- `androidboot.vbmeta*`
- `:=` may be only used to re-define `androidboot.mode`

Additionally, all data used to apply fixups to the bootconfig must be trusted.
In particular, if the protocol loads any data from non-secure storage, it must
verify that data before use.

#### NumDeviceTrees

The number of device tree components in the provided `DeviceTrees` array.

#### DeviceTrees

Pointer to an array containing loaded device tree components along with
associated metadata to distinguish device tree component types
(`GBL_EFI_DEVICE_TREE_METADATA.Type`) and identify the source from which it's
loaded (`GBL_EFI_DEVICE_TREE_METADATA.Source`).

### Description

A single set of Android build artifacts may include multiple device tree
components distributed across Android boot partitions such as `boot`,
`vendor_boot`, `dtb`, `dtbo`, etc. It is common practice to leverage this
capability to support multiple SoCs using the same set of artifacts, with the
appropriate device tree selected dynamically at the bootloader stage.

To support this use case, GBL loads all available device tree components and
provides them to the firmware along with associated metadata, enabling selection
via this UEFI call.

Firmware can use the `GBL_EFI_DEVICE_TREE_METADATA.Type` metadata field to
distinguish between different types of device tree components:

1. Device trees (`DEVICE_TREE`) — Base device tree.
2. Device tree overlays (`OVERLAY`) — Overlays to be applied to a base device
   tree.
3. Device assignment overlays (`PVM_DA_OVERLAY`) — Overlays to be applied to
   pVMs managed by [AVF][avf]. Device assignment overlay is distinguished from
   the regular host overlay by 31st bit of `dttable` `entry.id`:

   ```c
   bool entry_is_vm = (entry.id >> 31) & 0x1;
   ```

   It also affects the exposed `GBL_EFI_DEVICE_TREE_METADATA.Id` value since
   it's a pure copy of corresponding `entry.id`.

The `GBL_EFI_DEVICE_TREE_METADATA.Source` field identifies the origin partition
of each loaded device tree component (`BOOT`, `VENDOR_BOOT`, `DTBO`, `DTB`,
`FIT`).

Selection is performed by setting `GBL_EFI_VERIFIED_DEVICE_TREE.Selected` to
`TRUE` on the firmware side, following these rules:

1. Exactly one device tree must be selected. GBL will refuse to boot if none or
   multiple base device trees are selected.
2. Overlays are guaranteed to be provided in the same order as they appear in
   the `dtbo` partition and the selected ones are applied in that same order.
   Any number of overlays may be selected, including none.
3. At most one pVM device assignment overlay can be selected. If multiple such
   overlays are selected, GBL will refuse to boot.

`EFI_UNSUPPORTED` may be returned to indicate that firmware-specific selection
isn't required. GBL will use its default autoselection logic, which selects the
single provided base device tree without applying any overlays. GBL will fail to
boot if more than one base device tree is provided by the boot partitions. No
pVM device assignment overlays will be selected by the autoselection logic.

## GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL.SelectFitConfiguration()

### Summary

Inspects FIT configurations and selects the configuration to be used for the
platform.

### Prototype

```c
typedef
EFI_STATUS
(EFIAPI *GBL_EFI_SELECT_FIT_CONFIGURATION)(
  IN GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL *Self,
  IN UINTN                             FitSize,
  IN CONST UINT8                       *Fit,
  IN UINTN                             MetadataSize,
  IN CONST UINT8                       *Metadata,
  OUT UINTN                            *SelectedConfigurationOffset
  );
```

### Parameters

Ownership of all the parameters is loaned only for the duration of the function
call, and must not be retained by the protocol after returning.

#### Self

A pointer to the `GBL_EFI_OS_CONFIGURATION_PROTOCOL` instance.

#### FitSize

Size of the FIT FDT buffer.

#### Fit

Pointer to the FIT FDT loaded by GBL.

#### MetadataSize

Size of the metadata payload. The size is guaranteed to be `0` if `Metadata` is
NULL.

#### Metadata

Pointer to the first FIT image payload if the type is set to "metadata".

GBL requires the metadata payload to be referenced by the first sub-node inside
the `/images` node in FIT FDT. The sub-node for metadata must have type set to
"metadata".

If no such metadata node is found, this parameter will have a `NULL` value.

#### SelectedConfigurationOffset

Pointer to a value to be set by the firmware with the offset of the selected
configuration node within the `Fit` FDT.

### Description

A single FIT image can contain multiple configurations with various images -
kernel, DTB, ramdisk, etc. Each configuration can have a different set of images
corresponding to the platform on which images need to be loaded. Present GBL
implementation supports only device tree selection via FIT image.

The appropriate configuration can be dynamically selected by the firmware at
runtime based on the platform. Firmware can use the `Metadata` parameter to read
additional information required for comparing the configuration entries present
in the FIT image.

Exactly one FIT configuration must be selected. GBL will refuse to boot if no
configuration is selected. `EFI_UNSUPPORTED` may be returned to indicate that
firmware-specific selection isn't required. In this case, GBL will use
traditional device tree selection and ignore the FIT image entirely.

### Status Codes Returned

| Return Code             | Semantics                                             |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `EFI_SUCCESS`           | FIT configuration has been selected.                  |
| `EFI_UNSUPPORTED`       | No configuration selected; GBL will continue to boot. |
| `EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER` | Unexpected input; GBL will refuse to boot.            |
