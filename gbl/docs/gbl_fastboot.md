# Fastboot in GBL

This document describes Fastboot in the [GBL UEFI bootloader](../efi/BUILD).

## Transport

The GBL UEFI bootloader supports both Fastboot over TCP and USB. To enable
Fastboot over TCP, the UEFI loader needs to implement the
`EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL`. To enable Fastboot on other platform-specific
channels such as USB, the
[`GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL`][gbl_efi_fastboot_transport_protocol]
protocol is required. GBL automatically establishes the corresponding transport
channel if the required protocol is available.

## Common Target Variables

GBL fastboot supports flexible access to storage using this format:

`fastboot {flash,erase,fetch} part/storage_id/offset/size`

The following variables areused to construct targets across various commands:

- `<part>` (Required: production builds, Optional: dev builds): The name of the
  partition to operate on. This must be a valid, non-empty partition name on
  production builds.
- `<storage_id>` (Optional): A hex string representing a unique integer ID
  assigned to each storage device detected by GBL. If `storage_id` is not given,
  GBL will check if a default storage ID is set via
  `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <storage_id>` and use the default ID if
  set. If the default ID is not set, GBL will check that `part` can match to a
  unique partition. Otherwise, it will be rejected. The default ID can be unset
  via `fastboot oem gbl-unset-default-block`.
- `<offset>` (Optional): A 64-bit integer hex string which defaults to 0 if not
  given.
- `<size>` (Optional): A 64-bit integer that defaults to the rest of the
  partition after `offset` if not given.

## The Partition Argument

Fastboot commands such as `fastboot flash`, `fastboot fetch` and
`fastboot getvar partition-size` operate on partitions and require a partition
name argument. See this [doc](./partitions.md) for how GBL defines and handles
partitions on storage devices. The information of detected storage devices is
included in the output of `getvar all`. The partition layout for each of them
can be displayed by `oem gbl-partition-info`.

GBL fastboot additionally supports accessing sub ranges of partitions and
disambiguating between same name partitions on multiple storage devices (i.e. in
the presence of external or removable boot storage). The following summarizes
the supported syntaxes for the partition name argument in fastboot.

- Partition

  ```sh
  <part>[/<storage_id>]
  <part>/[<storage_id>][/<offset>]
  <part>/[<storage_id>]/[<offset>][/<size>]
  ```

  This specifies the range `[offset, offset+size)` in partition `part` on the
  storage device with ID `storage_id`.

  Examples:

  - `fastboot flash boot_a` -- If there is only one storage or a default storage
    ID is set via `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <default ID>`, flashes in
    the entire range of the storage. If not, checks that `boot_a` can match to a
    unique partition among all storage devices and flashes to it.
  - `fastboot flash boot_a/0x0` or `boot_a/0` -- Flashes in the entire range of
    partition "boot_a" on storage device 0.
  - `fastboot flash boot_a/0/200` -- Flashes only in range `[512, end)` of
    partition "boot_a" on storage device 0.
  - `fastboot flash boot_a/0/200/200` -- Flashes only in range `[512, 1024)` of
    partition "boot_a" on storage device 0.
  - `fastboot flash boot_a///` -- Same as `"fastboot flash boot_a"`.
  - `fastboot flash boot_a//200/200` -- Same as `"fastboot flash boot_a///"`,
    except that it only flashes in range `[512, 1024)`

- Raw storage devices by ID

  Note: Omitting the partition name is restricted to development builds compiled
  with the `gbl_dev` feature enabled. Production builds will reject these
  queries with a "partition name is required" error.

  ```
  /[<storage_id>]
  /[<storage_id>][/<offset>]
  /[<storage_id>][/<offset>][/<size>]
  ```

  This is similar to the case of partition except that `part` is an empty
  string. It specifies range`[offset, offset+size)` of the raw data on the
  storage device with ID `storage_id`. If `storage_id` is not given, GBL will
  check if a default storage ID is set via
  `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <storage_id>` and use the default ID if
  set. Otherwise it is rejected. `offset` defaults to 0 if not given. `size`
  defaults to the rest of the block after `offset` if not given. This semantic
  applies to all storage devices that can be detected by GBL, whether or not
  they are raw storage partitions or GPT devices.

  Examples:
  - `fastboot flash /` -- If there is only one storage or a default storage ID
    is set via `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <default ID>`, flashes in the
    entire range of the storage.
  - `fastboot flash /0x0` or `/0` -- Flashes in the entire range of storage
    device 0.
  - `fastboot flash /0/200` -- Flashes only in range `[512, end)` of storage
    device 0.
  - `fastboot flash /0/200/200` -- Flashes only in range `[512, 1024)` of
    storage device 0.
  - `fastboot flash ///` -- Same as `"fastboot flash /"`.
  - `fastboot flash //200/200` -- Same as `"fastboot flash ///"`, except that it
    only flashes in range `[512, 1024)`

Note: AOSP fastboot client tool introduces a special flash command syntax
`fastboot flash vendor_boot_a:<part_size>` for performing vendor ramdisk
repacking and flashing. This however, does not work with GBL's `'/'` syntax
discussed above, i.e. `fastboot flash vendor_boot_a/0:<part_size>` will not
trigger the repack and flash flow for the vendor_boot_a partition on storage 0
as might be expected. Instead, in this case, user should run
`fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block 0` to set the default block to 0 first and
then use `fastboot flash vendor_boot_a:<part size>` normally.

### Updating GPT Partition Table

GBL supports the following syntaxes for updating GPT partition table on a
storage device:

```sh
fastboot flash gpt <path to MBR+primary GPT blob file>
fastboot flash gpt/<storage_id> <path to MBR+primary GPT blob file>
fastboot flash gpt/[<storage_id>][/resize] <path to MBR+primary GPT blob file>
```

User must provide an image file that contains a MBR block and the primary GPT
header and entries. The above command will verify the given GPT and update it to
the specified storage device. If the `resize` option is given, GBL will adjust
the ending block of the last partition entry to cover the rest of the storage.
This is useful for sharing one single GPT blob file for different devices with
varying size of storage.

Examples:

- `fastboot flash gpt` -- If there is only one storage or a default storage ID
  is set via `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <default ID>`, updates the GPT
  of that storage.
- `fastboot flash gpt//resize` -- Same as `fastboot flash gpt` but also performs
  resizing.
- `fastboot flash gpt/0` -- Update GPT to storage device 0.
- `fastboot flash gpt/0/resize` -- Same as `fastboot flash gpt/0` but also
  performs resizing.

To erase existing GPT partition table on a storage device, use:

```sh
fastboot erase gpt
fastboot erase gpt/<storage_id>
```

Note: The above only erases GPT partition table. Partition content remains
unchanged.

Examples:

- `fastboot erase gpt` -- If there is only one storage or a default storage ID
  is set via `fastboot oem gbl-set-default-block <default ID>`, erase the GPT of
  that storage.
- `fastboot erase gpt/0` -- Erase GPT to storage device 0.

## Non-blocking Flash

If the UEFI firmware supports `EFI_BLOCK_IO2_PROTOCOL` for the storage devices,
GBL Fastboot provides an option to make `fastboot flash` non-blocking.
Specifically, after the image is downloaded, GBL Fastboot will launch a separate
task in the background for writing the image to the device, while itself will
continue to listen for the next Fastboot command from the host, including a new
`fastboot flash` command. This provides some parallelism between downloading and
flashing when the host is flashing multiple images. Example:

```sh
fastboot oem gbl-enable-async-task
fastboot flash boot_a <image>
fastboot flash boot_b <image>
fastboot flash vendor_boot_a <image>
...
fastboot oem gbl-sync-blocks
fastboot oem gbl-disable-async-task
```

If a storage device is busy processing a previous flash when a new image is
downloaded and ready to be flashed, it will be blocked until the previous flash
is completed. Different storage devices are independent to each other.

Because IO is now non-blocking, the return status of a `fastboot flash` does not
necessarily represent the status of the IO. If a storage device encounters
errors while processing a non-blocking IO, all subsequent flash requests will be
rejected and the host should reboot the device. `fastboot oem gbl-sync-blocks`
can be used to wait until all currently pending flashes are completed. The
command returns error if any previous or current flash encounters errors.

## Fastboot Boot for Fuchsia

In Fuchsia mode, the image format for "fastboot boot" is ZBI followed by vbmeta
image concatenated together, i.e.:

```sh
$ cat zircon_a.zbi vbmeta_a > zircon_fastboot.img
$ fastboot boot zircon_fastboot.img
```

Note: In unlocked mode, it's possible to omit the vbmeta image. Verification
will fail as expected, but boot will proceed since it is unlocked.

## Pause in Fastboot after Loading OS

GBL supports pausing in fastboot after loading, verifying and fixing-up OS. This
is primarily used to inspect device post-load state for testing and analysis.
There are two ways to enable this:

1. Run `fastboot oem gbl-pause-fastboot-after-load` when in pre-load fastboot
   mode.

1. Add build option `--@gbl//toolchain:pause_boot_in_fastboot` to bazel. This
   will force GBL to always pause in fastboot after loading OS.

`fastboot continue` in this stage of fastboot behaves differently for dev/prod
build:

1. For dev build, `fastboot continue` continues to boot loaded images.
2. For prod build, `fastboot continue` always triggers a reboot.

## GBL Fastboot UI

This section describes how to create a UI interface that can be used to execute
fastboot commands. The implementation must be based on the
[`GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL`][gbl_efi_fastboot_transport_protocol].

### GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL for UI

A fastboot UI can be implemented as a separate
`GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL`. This allows GBL to discover and use the
UI as a fastboot transport, just like USB or other custom channels.

GBL loops over all discovered transports. Each transport would get `receive()`
call and `send()` if necessary after packet processing. E.g. of very simplified
logic on GBL side:

```c++
loop {
    for_each(transport in discovered_transports) {
        transport.receive(transport, buffer);
        process_received_packet(buffer);
        transport.send(reply);
    }
}
```

#### Protocol Interface Structure

The [`GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL`][gbl_efi_fastboot_transport_protocol]
is defined as follows:

```c
typedef struct _GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL {
  UINT64                                     Revision;
  CONST CHAR8                                *Description;
  GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_INTERFACE_START Start;
  GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_INTERFACE_STOP  Stop;
  GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_RECEIVE         Receive;
  GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_SEND            Send;
  GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_FLUSH           Flush;
} GBL_EFI_FASTBOOT_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL;
```

#### UI Implementation Details

##### Start

The `Start` function should be used to initialize the UI. This includes setting
up the screen, drawing the initial UI elements, and starting a timer for polling
for user input.

##### Stop

The `Stop` function should be used to de-initialize the UI. This includes
clearing the screen and stopping the timer.

##### Receive

The `Receive` function is called by GBL to get a fastboot command from the UI.
When called with `Mode` as `SINGLE_PACKET`, the UI should check if a fastboot
command is available (e.g., from a button press). If a command is available, it
should be copied to the `Buffer` and the function should return `EFI_SUCCESS`.
If no command is available, the function should return `EFI_SUCCESS` and 0
buffer size.

**Important:** The `Receive` function should not be used for polling. The UI
driver should have a separate timer-based main loop that does UI updates and key
press polling. This is because GBL cannot guarantee regular `Receive` calls. For
example, fastboot could be processing a long command like `flash` and GBL would
not be polling other protocols for input while `flash` is in process. So
`Receive` should only be used to send fastboot commands.

##### Send

The `Send` function is called by GBL to send a message to the UI. This can be
used to display the status of a command (e.g., "OKAY", "FAIL") if needed.

##### Flush

The `Flush` function is called by GBL to wait for all pending `Send` operations
to complete. The UI should wait until all messages have been displayed.

#### Example UI Flow

1.  GBL calls `Start` to initialize the UI.
2.  The UI driver starts a timer and begins polling for user input in its own
    main loop.
3.  The user presses a button to execute a fastboot command (e.g., "getvar:all")
4.  The UI driver stores the command in a buffer.
5.  GBL calls `Receive`.
6.  The UI driver copies the command to the buffer provided by GBL and returns
    `EFI_SUCCESS`.
7.  GBL executes the command.
8.  GBL calls `Send` to display the result of the command(s). In this case
    multiple "INFO" with final "OKAY".
9.  Depending on desired behaviour the UI driver may display the message on the
    screen. (may be defered to main loop)
10. GBL calls `Stop` to de-initialize the UI.
